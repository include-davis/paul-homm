          <p>The term Patient Advocate aptly describes an undergraduate volunteer at the Paul Hom Asian Clinic. Patient Advocates mainly act as interpreters for predominantly Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese patients who visit the clinic. They also have a variety of responsibilities such as in taking vital signs, assisting in the dispensing of medications, and assisting medical students with patient care. They continue to play an important role as patient educators and interpreters for our clinic. In addition, they have the opportunity to learn more about providing social services to the underserved.<p>
